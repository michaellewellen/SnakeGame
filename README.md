# SnakeGame

I've assigned this project to my students for the last 2 years, and never completed the lab itself. 

It seemed a logical extension of the factory we built in labs 9 and 10,   if you can draw a shape at any center with given dimension it shouldn't be that hard to make a list of those shapes to build a snake, and load apples for the snake to grab.  

* principles:
* create a 'grid' structore that is 4 columns wide, and 2 rows high..... this creates squares that are roughly square...
* Randomly add a chain of three 'squares' and color them 'green'
* Randomly add a single 'square' colored red
* To simulate movement, add a new 'head' in the direction pressed by the player
* 'display' the tail in black and remove it from the list.
* Upon apple eating add the head but do NOT remove the tail (adding one to the list.

* Enahncements added after the basic.
* Multi colored apples that change the snakes colore
* Added eyeballs to my snake
* added sound effects with apple eat
* added scoring into the corner
* added border for walls
* added death by hitting a wall or eating yourself
*
